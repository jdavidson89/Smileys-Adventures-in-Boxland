# Smileys-Adventures-in-Boxland
This is my first ever attempt at making a 3D Game using the Godot Game
Engine,  It is a simple game I am uploading merely for historical reference
for myself, I doubt it will be of interest to anyone but feel free to have a
go, I will probably add releases with it compiled for various systems.

The Model Smiley.glb was made by me in blender along with all png files made
with GIMP.

I release everything I added to the godot engine under the MIT Licence as
well in alignment with the Godot game engine licensing.  If you actually 
found this and gave it a try hope it made you smile as much as my 
kids did when they played it.
